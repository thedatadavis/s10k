title: Simple, Not Easy

There is a difference between simple and easy.

A lot of times, people will think something is easy when what they really mean is it’s simple.

Simple means something is straightforward, conceptually. There’s a clear path from A to B.

That doesn’t necessarily mean it’s easy to execute those steps. In fact, many things that are simple are hard to do.

For example, the concept of hiking is simple: just* walk along the well-trodden path and take in the scenery.

But, as some of you know, getting to the end of the trail can be anything but easy.

:::tip[On “Just”]
The usage of just (as in “I’ll just do x” or “why can’t you just do y”)  is usually a tell-tale sign that the concept being discussed is only understood at a surface level — it’s simple, but not necessarily easy.

Tip: when saying or thinking just, write down the steps involved that you’re seemingly hand waving over to make sure you’re not missing anything.

Starting a software business is simple, but not easy.

My goal in writing this guide is to provide some tools that will help make the journey less daunting.
